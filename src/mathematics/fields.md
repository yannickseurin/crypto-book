## Polynomials Over Fields

Moreover, if we define scalar multiplication of a polynomial $p(X)$ by $a \in \FF$ as multiplication by the constant polynomial $a(X) = a$, then $\FF[X]$ is a vector space over $\FF$.
The set $\{1, X, X^2, \dots\}$ is a basis of this vector space called the ***monomial basis***.
